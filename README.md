# Python-program-Terminal-based-four-operations-calculator
I have successfully created a full-fledged program based on the knowledge I gained learning Python 3 for the past few months. It is a four-operations calculator that can be run from the terminal.

# About the calculator
The calculator is a basic calculator that can calculate values in any of the four operations; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division accurately. It runs in Terminal/Command Prompt.

You can download the Python file below and run it in Terminal/Command Prompt. Youâ€™ll need to have an IDE and Python 3 installed.

# The python file is subject to change in the near future.
